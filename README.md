## What's this ‚ùì

This game is a text-based game with [ASCII graphics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art) created using the [BASIC language](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC) in the [QB64 IDE](https://github.com/QB64Team/qb64). I believe I made this game when I was around 12 years old. I recall sitting on a stool in my living room facing the guest computer (the computer that I did all my programming on) spending countless hours and many weeks or months creating this game and many others. I learned BASIC from my uncle and I was so intrigued that I began programming all the time and haven't stopped since.

This is one of my first fully fledged games that I created of which I still have the original source code for. I remember that my first game was actually another BASIC game titled "Tower Trials," but I only have binary files of it. I can't find the source code of it unfortunately üòî.

This game comes complete with saving functionality so that's pretty cool. Also, this game is meant to be played with 2 people. On first booting it up, it asks for two names: the captain and the commander. I think that when I created the game o' so long ago, I envisioned that the two people were supposed to collaborate on strategizing their way through the game. There is also a versus mode so the captain and commander can duke it out themselves. Furthermore, there is an in-game shop that unlocks more levels of the game and completionary badges for the perfectionist players.
